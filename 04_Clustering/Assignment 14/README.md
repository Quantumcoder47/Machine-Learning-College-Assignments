# Assignment 14 — Hierarchical Clustering for Vehicle Grouping

Summary
- Demonstrates hierarchical clustering (agglomerative) and dendrograms on vehicle data. The notebook constructs (or loads) vehicle features, applies different linkage methods, and visualizes clusters and dendrograms.

Dataset
- `Vehicle.csv` — columns include:
  manufact, model, sales, resale, type, price, engine_s, horsepow, wheelbas, width, length, curb_wgt, fuel_cap, mpg, lnsales, partition

How to run
- Open `model.ipynb`. Requires pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib.

Notes
- The notebook may generate synthetic vehicle data as part of the demo; `Vehicle.csv` is available for alternate experiments.
