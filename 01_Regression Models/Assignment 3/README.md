# Assignment 3 — Linear Regression (Gradient Descent from Scratch)

Summary
- Educational notebook implementing linear regression using gradient descent without sklearn. Covers hypothesis, cost function, gradient updates, training loops and visualization of learning progress.

Dataset
- `salary_data.csv` — columns:
  YearsExperience, Salary

How to run
- Open `model.ipynb`. This notebook implements models from scratch; only numpy, matplotlib and pandas are required.

Notes
- Ideal for understanding optimization and gradient descent; quick to run due to small dataset.
