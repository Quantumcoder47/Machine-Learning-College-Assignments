# Assignment 1B — Linear Regression for Car Price Prediction

Summary
- Beginner-friendly notebook to predict used car selling prices using linear regression. Covers cleaning (duplicates/outliers), feature engineering (age, brand, fuel encoding), scaling, training, and evaluation.

Dataset
- `used_cars_dataset.csv` — columns:
  name, year, km_driven, fuel, seller_type, transmission, owner, selling_price

How to run
- Launch `model.ipynb`, run step-by-step. Recommended install: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib.

Notes
- Notebook performs non-trivial cleaning and feature engineering; sample ranges/filters are applied in notebook code.
