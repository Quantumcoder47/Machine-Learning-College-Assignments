# Assignment 12 — Iris Classification / Neural Network Experiments

Summary
- Demonstrates neural network (MLP) experiments on the Iris dataset. Explores architectures, scaling, training configurations and performance comparison across different activation/solver combinations.

Dataset
- `iris.csv` — columns:
  sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, species

How to run
- Open `model.ipynb`. Requires pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib.

Notes
- The notebook also shows using sklearn's built-in Iris loader (so both `iris.csv` and sklearn's dataset may be referenced).
