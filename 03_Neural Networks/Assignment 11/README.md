# Assignment 11 — XOR Neural Network / Perceptron Examples

Summary
- Educational notebook building neural networks (MLP) to solve the XOR problem and demonstrating why single perceptrons fail. Includes a custom MLP using sklearn's MLPClassifier and visualizations of decision boundaries and network architecture.

Dataset
- No external CSV — the XOR dataset is created inline in the notebook (4 binary examples). Some examples use sklearn datasets/APIs.

How to run
- Open `model.ipynb`. Requires numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn.

Notes
- Small, fast notebook meant for conceptual understanding of multi-layer networks.
